# PenaPelotGrill2023JNER
Code to generate Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 of the manuscript "Spatiotemporal Parameters for Energy Efficient Kilohertz-Frequency Nerve Block with Low Onset Response" (Peña, Pelot, Grill 2023 JNER)

First, you must download the data, which is persistently available on Duke University’s Research Data Repository (_insert link here_). Next run the scripts to produce the desired figures:
- To produce Figure 2, run summary_plot_min_freqs.m
- To produce Figures 3, 4, 5, run regression_electrodes_frequencies_nerves.m
- To produce Figures 7, 8, 9, run plot_shape_effects_on_onset_auc.m
